Raven functional validation
----------------------------------------------
This test system uses tclftdi 1.0
(http://opencircuitdesign.com/tclftdi/)

------------------------------------------------------------
To program the SPI flash chip:

  1. Configure the board for flash programming.

      For test board v1.1:
      A. Move jumper J1 2nd position (DUT 3.3V) to 4th position (FTDI 1.8V)
      B. Move jumper J2 bottom position (pins 2-3) to top position (pins 1-2)
      C. Preferably remove the data connection to the display.

  2. In this directory, run (as root)

      tclftdi startup_flash.tcl

  3. At the prompt, do:

      write_flash ftdi0 raven_demo_full_test.hex

  4. Configure the board for processor operation

      A. Move jumper J1 4th position (FTDI 1.8V) to 2nd position (DUT 3.3)
      B. Move jumper J2 position (pins 1-2) to bottom position (pins 2-3)
      C. Reconnect data connection to the display, if removed.

To communicate with the Raven housekeeping SPI:

  1. Configure the board for processor operation (see above)

  2. In this directory, run (as root)

      tclftdi startup_raven.tcl

  3. The tool will show the various commands that can be used
     to access and manipulate the Raven processor through the
     SPI interface.
